Here's an example to illustrate the process:

Let's convert the decimal value -5 to its 8-bit two's complement representation:

    Start with the binary representation of the positive value 5: 00000101.

    Since we are using an 8-bit representation, pad it with leading zeros: 00000101.

    Flip all the bits: 11111010.

    Add 1 to the resulting binary number: 11111011.

The resulting binary representation is 11111011, which is the 8-bit two's complement representation of -5.

It's important to note that in two's complement representation, the leftmost bit is the sign bit. If the sign bit is 1, 
the number is negative, and if the sign bit is 0, the number is positive. The remaining bits represent the magnitude of the number.


Here's an example to illustrate the process:

Let's convert the binary value 11111011 to its corresponding decimal (integer) value:

    The binary value has a width of 8 bits.

    The leftmost bit is 1, indicating a negative number.

    Perform two's complement on the remaining bits (remove the sign bit and flip the bits): 
    
    ~(11111011) = (00000100) //1'st complement
    00000100 + 1 = 00000101
    

    Convert the resulting magnitude, 00000101, to decimal: 5.

    Assign a negative sign to the decimal value obtained in step 4: -5.

So, the binary value 11111011 represents the decimal value -5.
